# Hi I'm Felipe 💻

I'm a Sr. Software Engineer at [Dell][dell], where I make sure production environments and inter-system boundaries are always reliable through monitoring and automated troubleshooting... which sometimes involves casting spells and powering things off and on again.

I also write about technology in a [blog][blog] and contribute to assorted open source projects.
