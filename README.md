# Hi! I'm Felipe! ⌨️

I write about computers in a [blog][blog] ✍️ and contribute to assorted open source projects.

I like understanding how everything works under the hood from transistors and CPU microcode 🔬 to large distributed systems.

My biggest passions in software development are around embedded, compilers and graphics.

Some interesting recent projects:

- [slc][slc]: amd64 compiler in 300 lines
- [elliptic-curves][elliptic]: Julia ECC
- [q30m][q30m]: Quantum Mechanics in 30 Minutes
